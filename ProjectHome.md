This is JavaME midlet, and requires the mobile phone to be CLDC 1.1 and MIDP 2 capable.

This calendar has the following features:
- Shows today day of week name in Persian
- Shows the date of today in 3 different calendars: Persian (Jalali or Hijri Shamsi), Islamic (Hijri Qamari) and Civil (Gregorian).
- Converts between dates of these 3 calendars

These are the features to be included in future releases:
- Moving through the calendar and viewing details about each day
- Details about each day includes:
  * The date in all calendars
  * The day of week name
  * The calendar event of the day
  * If the day is a holiday
  * Prayer times of the day
- Adding personal notes and reminders to a day
- Availability of a T9-like dictionary that enables fast entry of Persian texts (Note: this feature is a bigger project itself! and can be used in other potential projects relating to entering Persian text in mobile phone, like composing SMSs)
- Viewing and modifying weekly/monthly schedules
And possibly more features in future.

You are kindly invited to participate in this project. The only prerequisites for participation is knowing Java (and preferably Java ME), and loving Persian and/or Islamic culture!
